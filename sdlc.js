// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis = "This is the second step, this phase formally defines the detailed functional user requirements using high-level requirements identified in the Initiation and Feasibility Phases"

const design = "This is the third step and essential phase. In the design phase, one or more designs are created to achieve the project result."

const implementation = "This is the 4th step, in which the system is installed to support the intended business functions"

const testing = "This is the 5th stage, in which developers find out whether their code and programming work according to customer requirements"

const maintain = "This is the final phase and is where the software is monitored to ensure it continues to function as it was designed to, and repairs or upgrades are performed as needed"
